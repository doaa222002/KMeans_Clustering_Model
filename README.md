# KMeans_Clustering_Model
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised learning technique used to group data into clusters based on similarity. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, while the Silhouette Score was used to evaluate cluster quality, ensuring meaningful and well-defined groupings.
